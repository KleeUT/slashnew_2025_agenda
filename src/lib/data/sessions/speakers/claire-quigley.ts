			bio: `
Claire, Director of [Tech Team Whisperer](http://www.techteamwhisperer.com/), is a transformative leader guiding teams to break free from outdated norms and drive meaningful organisational change through technology and innovation. As Deputy Chair of [Hunter iF](http://www.hunterif.com.au/), she plays a crucial role in fostering regional growth by building impactful connections and driving collaboration.

With over 25 years of experience in technology, strategy, and innovation, Claire's journey spans high-tech startups, major corporate roles, and regional development. Her expertise ranges from commercialising research at the [Walton Institute](https://waltoninstitute.ie/) to leading businesses through economic transition as 2IC at Waterford Chamber, and driving innovation in global collaborations at [Canon Australia](https://www.canon.com.au/).

Claire's mission is simple yet powerful: challenge the status quo, prioritise people, and deliver results. Her passion for diversity, equity, and inclusion as the foundation of creativity and innovation fuels everything she does. As a judge for the [TechDiversity Awards](https://tech-diversity.com.au/td-awards/), she champions radical collaboration as the key to transformational outcomes.

When she's not sparking connection and creativity, Claire draws inspiration from life in the Upper Hunter NSW, surrounded by her lively family of humans, horses, and dogs.
