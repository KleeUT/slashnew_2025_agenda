This talk introduces the concept of slow coffee, a way to create space and time to get back to connecting with each other! You've seen people solving world problems over a Shisha in Morocco, challenging the approach of world economies over cannolis and espresso in Italy, but have you tried Pour Over? Pirate Coffee love Pour Over coffee as a way to slow down the mind and create a time to engage in 1:1 conversations around health and wellbeing while enjoying the amazing flavours of the world over epic coffee. In this workshop, you’ll get the chance to learn the art of slow coffee, taste delicious Pirate Coffee from exotic locations, as well as be part of an open conversation about mental well-being.

			bio: `
Damian Hamilton spent over 20 years leading sales and partnerships for global tech giants like HP and Dimension Data, driving serious growth across cloud, software, and enterprise IT. But these days, he’s more likely to be found behind a roaster than a whiteboard.
A proud Māori man, Damo is the co-founder of Pirate Coffee — a small batch roastery and social enterprise based in Port Stephens. What started as a love for specialty coffee has evolved into a platform for connection, conversation, and community wellbeing — with a strong focus on improving men’s mental health.
Through Pirate Labs, Damo is laying the groundwork for future ventures in advanced manufacturing, supply chain analytics, and tech-enabled food systems. It’s the IP and innovation arm of Pirate — where ideas are tested, systems are built, and regional tech gets serious.
At /NEW, he’ll be brewing slow coffee with long-time mate and NewyTechPeople founder James MacDonald — creating space for honest conversations, shared experience, and a fresh take on where technology meets humanity.
