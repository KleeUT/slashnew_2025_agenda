This talk introduces the concept of slow coffee, a way to create space and time to get back to connecting with each other! You've seen people solving world problems over a Shisha in Morocco, challenging the approach of world economies over cannolis and espresso in Italy, but have you tried Pour Over? Pirate Coffee love Pour Over coffee as a way to slow down the mind and create a time to engage in 1:1 conversations around health and wellbeing while enjoying the amazing flavours of the world over epic coffee. In this workshop, youâ€™ll get the chance to learn the art of slow coffee, taste delicious Pirate Coffee from exotic locations, as well as be part of an open conversation about mental well-being.
