	abstract: `
This talk introduces the concept of slow coffee, a way to create space and time to get back to connecting with each other! You've seen people solving world problems over a Shisha in Morocco, challenging the approach of world economies over cannolis and espresso in Italy, but have you tried Pour Over? Pirate Coffee love Pour Over coffee as a way to slow down the mind and create a time to engage in 1:1 conversations around health and wellbeing while enjoying the amazing flavours of the world over epic coffee. In this workshop, you’ll get the chance to learn the art of slow coffee, taste delicious Pirate Coffee from exotic locations, as well as be part of an open conversation about mental well-being.
