Come along for some mid conference fun. We'll be playing a game of Family Feud with the speakers vs Newcastle locals to see who knows the crowd better. 
There will be QR Codes around the venue for you to fill out the survey during the day. 
This session will not be recorded, so the speakers can get up and speak their mind without fear of it being shared online.
