			bio: `
Many people see career development as a thing that happens *to* them, not something they choose.

In this talk, we'll discuss the key skills and approaches that anyone can take to help shape their own career. Whether you're focused on landing your next role in an industry or domain that you're passionate about or turning your long-term plan into a reality, this talk contains practical, actionable advice for you.

Matt draws on his experiences navigating the tech industry, first as an IC and now as a manager, to help people take control of their careers and identify and reach their goals. A worked example of a fictional career journey serves as the lens through which we look at advice and anecdotes, strategies and stories that will inspire folks to career success.

This talk is primarily aimed at junior to mid-level software engineers, but the strategies discussed could be taken and applied to any type of IC role in the tech industry, including QA engineers, product managers and product / UX designers.
