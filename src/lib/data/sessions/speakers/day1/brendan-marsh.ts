	abstract: `
Bringing sound product practices into internal platform teams can be great at helping solve problems that bring real value to your internal customers. But how do you know you're working on the right problems? A product strategy is helpful to answer this question, but most of the product strategy conversation is about consumer facing products. In this talk, I'll share what I've learned from years of setting strategy for both consumer and internal platform products, from my time at Spotify and from my years consulting to enterprise and scale-ups that are trying to be product led in everything they do.
