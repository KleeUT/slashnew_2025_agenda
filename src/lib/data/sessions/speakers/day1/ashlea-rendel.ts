		'Continuous Product Discovery: How to Democratise Conversations with Customers to Build a Better Product',
	abstract: `
In this session I'll demystify continuous product discovery, teaching both product teams and researchers alike how to integrate research into the product lifecycle effectively. Drawing from 10 years experience in research, design and product, I'll share:
- What continuous discovery really means and who is best placed to do it
- Practical steps for building a collaborative, sustainable process
- How to overcome common challenges, including establishing stakeholder buy-in, managing capacity and reducing risk
- Some tips on where I think AI could be useful to augment, not replace, user research
Whether you're a researcher or designer looking to expand influence, a product manager seeking more confident direction, or a leader aiming to shift to a customer centred culture, this session will equip you with actionable strategies to embed human-centred decision making in your team's culture.
