The solution architecture design activity is critical for most (larger) IT initiatives and therefore needs careful planning. And by careful, I don't mean a plan with hundreds of tasks, but something more than the anti-pattern of "we'll see how we go for this sprint" or the dreaded "develop solution architecture" task.
