	abstract: `
For some, mining is a dirty word, for others it's their day to day. there is a huge disconnect, but with Human Centered design, we are making movements toward a sustainable future. So my talk would talk to the work at Bradken, but really more about an industry that is rapidly adapting, transforming to include digital innovation.

I've worked in several companies that talk to this in Syd/Melb and now Newy, it's sooo much about mining, i think that heavy industry is it's own talking point.

At the end of the day, right now it's a human in the pit of the mine.

We are already seeing remote trucks, i say, get people out of there!
There is a lot of fear about it, but if we focus on humans, step one is make it safer. No one is against that. So let's talk to step one and beyond.

Why HCD Matters in Heavy Industry
Human-Centered Design (HCD) is not just about making things look good—it’s about safety, efficiency, and real-world usability in high-risk industrial environments. Many corporate innovations fail because they ignore the people who actually use the products. By applying HCD principles, companies can reduce costly failures, increase adoption, and drive real impact.

Breaking Corporate Inertia with "Wagile" Execution
Heavy industry often operates within rigid corporate structures that resist fast innovation. A "wagile" approach—a hybrid of waterfall and agile methodologies—allows companies to balance the need for thorough validation with rapid iteration. This approach helps push HCD-driven solutions past internal roadblocks while maintaining compliance and operational standards.

From Factory Floor to Market: Product Success Stories
At Bradken, several industrial products have successfully gone from concept to market by leveraging HCD, AI insights, and real-world testing. These case studies show how integrating user feedback, lean methodologies, and data-driven design leads to safer, smarter, and more widely adopted industrial solutions.

The Future of Industrial Design: AI, Automation & UX
The next frontier of HCD in heavy industry involves AI, automation, and predictive analytics, ensuring products are not only functional but also adaptive to user needs. Designing for harsh, high-stakes environments requires rethinking how technology and human experience intersect to create future-proof solutions.

Key Takeaways: Turning HCD into a Competitive Advantage
Companies that prioritize HCD gain a competitive edge by improving usability, safety, and operational efficiency. This talk will leave you with three practical strategies to embed HCD in engineering-driven teams, navigate corporate barriers, and ensure that human-first innovation leads the way in industrial product design.
