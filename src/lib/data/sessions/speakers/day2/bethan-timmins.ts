	abstract: `
What if building better systems started with listening more deeply? In this talk, Bethan shares a story from her time improving digital services in government, where connecting with the people using these services reshaped how she approached complexity, trust, and inclusion. Through the lens of service design, she explores how human-centred tools can help engineers move beyond technical fixes and design for the realities people face every day.

			bio: `
I'm a Principal Software Delivery Consultant with a passion for creative problem solving and building things in the best way possible. I pride myself on accelerating time-to-market, making software services more reliable—both for teams building them and people using them—and building learning cultures in large scale organisations.

I often achieve these goals using the You Build It You Run It operating model, which I enjoy writing and speaking about. I've also co-authored a detailed playbook on the subject.

When I'm not working on any of the above, you'll find me enjoying the beaches in New South Wales with my dog, Doddie.
