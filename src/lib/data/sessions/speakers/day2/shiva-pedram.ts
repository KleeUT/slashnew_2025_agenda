		'Human-Centered Design in the Age of AI: Building Better Tech Through Human Factors and UX',
	abstract: `
As AI and emerging technologies continue to reshape industries, the success of innovation depends not just on technical capabilities but on how well these technologies integrate into human workflows, decision-making, and daily life. In this talk, I’ll explore the critical role of Human-Centered Design (HCD) and Human Factors in shaping the future of technology. We’ll look at how understanding human behaviour, cognition, and user experience (UX) can lead to more intuitive, ethical, and effective technology based solutions. Whether it’s improving decision-making, enhancing user trust, or designing seamless human-AI collaboration/teaming, these principles are key to building technology that truly serves people. Drawing on insights from the work at i3Lab, Australia’s leading research hub for Human-Computer Interaction, I’ll share how our research in user need analysis, usability testing, cognitive ergonomics, and emerging technologies like VR, AR, and AI can help tech startups and companies create impactful, human-centered solutions. We’ll also discuss how i3Lab can collaborate with the tech community to drive innovation that prioritizes the human experience.
