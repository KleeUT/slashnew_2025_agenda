	title: 'Driving Transformational Change through Creative Research and Storytelling',
	abstract: `
In fast-paced corporate and institutional environments, the ability to drive effective and lasting change through design research is an ongoing challenge. This talk explores these challenges and our successes in advocating for change through adopting creative storytelling techniques within our design research practice.
This conference talk aims to explore how robust research methods delivered through engaging multimedia storytelling can lead to impactful transformations within large organizations. Not only bringing attention to the quality of the research, but developing empathic responses from key stakeholders to ensure the findings are not overlooked amongst competing priorities.

You should attend if you’re interested in:
• How to conduct effective design research projects within large institutions and corporations
• How to emphasize the importance of returning to users throughout the design process to affirm research directions and decisions
• How to showcase feedback which may contain vulnerable customers or users
• How to provide insights which are impactful enough to drive change

Target Audience:
• HCI & UX Researchers
• HCI, UX and Service Designers
• Corporate Leaders
• Product Managers
• Project Leads
