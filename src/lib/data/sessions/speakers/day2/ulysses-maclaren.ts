	abstract: `
Generative AI has leapt from clever chatbots to self-directed digital coworkers, but most organisations still treat it as a plug-in for their existing processes. This session maps the journey from rule-based bots to AI-enabled workflows, then shows why 2025 belongs to true agents: systems that perceive, plan, and act with minimal hand-holding.

 

**You'll learn:**
* the key architectural differences between an AI workflow and an AI agent, and why it matters for risk, compliance, and ROI
* real-world case studies: From customer-service triage to research copilots and self-driving cars, highlighting where agents already outperform scripted flows
* a decision checklist for choosing workflows, agents, or a hybrid approach
* emerging security, governance, and cost trends that make autonomous agents viable right now
* a practical adoption roadmap that moves from low-risk internal pilots to outward-facing, value-generating agents.
Expect candid lessons from shipping AI solutions in production, concrete metrics you can steal, and a clear view of what’s coming next, so you can decide where agents fit in your own organisation without the sales pitch.
