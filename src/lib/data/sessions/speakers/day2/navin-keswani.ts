	abstract: `
Software development teams across different roles (from individual contributors to senior leaders) are working hard to optimize for quality and deliver successful products while managing their energy and wellbeing.

Despite their best efforts, many team members experience snowballing stress that causes burnout, impacting both their personal wellbeing and professional effectiveness. Current approaches to managing stress and recovery are often reactive and not systematically integrated into the processes that govern software and product development.

How can we create a sustainable system that enables engineering teams to flourish while preventing burnout across all roles in the product engineering organization?

Drawing from peer-reviewed psychological research and real-world case studies from high-performing sustainable teams, we present a practical mental model that:

1. Actively limits harmful stress

2. Systematically prioritizes effective recovery

3. Enables dynamic adjustments based on changing conditions

The presentation will demonstrate this system through concrete examples relevant to individual contributors, team leads, and senior leaders, allowing audience members to directly apply these insights to their specific roles and contexts.

			bio: `
I design and build software systems and lead engineering teams. As a hands-on leader, my focus is on helping other engineers get things done and grow in their careers. I enjoy continuously learning and practicing the art of programming, in the large and in the small. My aim is to support the long-term health of people, teams, and the software systems they build.

I co-founded Anamorphic Digital to advance the regenerative economy. Our first product, TANK, helps people find flourishing while beating burnout. I also consult with early-stage startups, particularly on projects that make complex policy decisions more approachable.

I hold a PhD in pure mathematics and a bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science.
