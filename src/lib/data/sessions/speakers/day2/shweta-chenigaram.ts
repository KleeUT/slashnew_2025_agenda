Ah, technology! As developers we love to write great code, solve problems, and make things work. Yet, the reality is we spend a lot of time reviewing code, writing documentation, and doing the plumbing that makes this talk to that and spend less time figuring out awesome algorithms that really change the dial for our businesses.

With all the talk of AI everywhere, I've been exploring the use of AI assistants to help streamline my tasks, code, pull requests, deployments, and more, integrating right into Visual Studio Code and Azure DevOps.

Instead of worrying that AI coders might come and take all our jobs, we can embrace assistive AI that helps us streamline the dull parts letting us focus more on designing our architecture. It's like having your very own tireless junior developer who might not fetch you coffee but will never get upset by how many times you ask them to check this or that in, build something, or update a config.

What's more, your AI assistant can help ensure you have unit tests (because we all know we should, right ...) and keep them up to date, and the more and better unit tests you have, the more reliable and trustworthy your releases become.

In this talk I'll share my experiences plus give tips and tricks I've learned from putting it to use
