	abstract: `
In the last 20 years I've been involved in a lot of MVP's. There's a lot of opinions out there about how Minimal you should go, what Viable means, and how to get a Product at the end of it. I'll talk through what these words mean to me, how to approach your own MVP, and whether you should be doing one at all.
